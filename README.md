# Embedded Systems Portfolio – Bùi Minh Thùy

## About Me  
I'm an Embedded Systems Engineer based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.  
I specialize in microcontroller programming, sensor integration, and embedded software testing.  
This portfolio showcases my academic and personal projects using platforms like ESP32, STM32, and AT89S51.

## Objective  
To apply embedded systems knowledge in developing efficient, scalable, and real-world solutions.  
I'm passionate about continuous learning and currently expanding my skills in AUTOSAR, RTOS, and Japanese language.

## Projects

### Smart Desk – ESP32 + Sensors + Web Interface  
Reimplementation of a smart desk system with DHT22, PIR, and LDR sensors.  
Includes real-time data display via a custom web dashboard.

### GPT Driver Audit – FPT Training  
Tested GPT driver functions based on AUTOSAR standards.  
Executed structured test cases and documented results.

### RGB LED CAN Control – FPT Training  
Analyzed and documented CAN-based RGB LED control system using S32K144.  
Explored CAN message structure and communication setup.

### Sound-Responsive LED Matrix – AT89S51  
Team-based project using KY-037 and ADC0804.  
Designed and tested LED matrix reacting to sound intensity.
